LiveData MVVM Architecture Example
This is a simple Android app that demonstrates the usage of LiveData and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. It displays a list of items using LiveData to achieve data binding and efficient UI updates.

Introduction
This app showcases how LiveData and MVVM can be used to achieve a loosely coupled and maintainable architecture for Android applications. LiveData is utilized to observe changes in data and automatically update the UI components when the underlying data changes. The MVVM pattern promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

Features
Displays a list of items using RecyclerView.
Utilizes LiveData to observe changes in the item list and automatically update the UI.
Demonstrates how ViewModel acts as a mediator between the UI and the data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Android Studio (latest version recommended)
Kotlin programming language knowledge
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sunil-singh-chaudhary/MVVM_kotlin.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

Code Overview
Item Model
The Item data class represents the model for each item in the list.

ViewModel
The ItemViewModel class serves as the ViewModel. It manages the data and business logic, exposing the item list through a LiveData property. The loadItems method simulates data loading.

MainActivity
The MainActivity observes changes in the itemList LiveData from the ViewModel and updates the RecyclerView's adapter accordingly.

ItemAdapter
The ItemAdapter extends ListAdapter and is responsible for inflating and binding the item layout to each item in the RecyclerView.

Layout Resources
The layout files (activity_main.xml and item_layout.xml) define the UI components' structure and appearance.
